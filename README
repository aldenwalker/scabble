Version 1.0 - December 3, 2010




scabble uses the same theory as scallop to produce the unit scl ball in a 
2-plane spanned by two chains.  The syntax is:
./scabble [-v] [-mn] [-glpk] filename chain1 , chain2
for example, 
./scabble test aabAAB , abAB
It outputs a drawing of the unit ball to filename.eps.
-mn overrides the number of polygon sides to n
-v causes verbose output
By default, scabble uses exlp and GMP for all computations.  To use glpk instead,
use the -glpk option.
scabble will take integer coefficients on the input words, so 
./scabble test 5aabAAB , 7abAB
works.

Compilation:
-----------

Requirements:
You need glpk and gmp installed in your path (i.e. somewhere that g++ can find
the header files and libraries).  


To compile, just type:

make

Because scabble uses the same strategy to compute scl as scallop, the same 
comments on rigor are appropriate (and the same fix applicable):

------
Rigour:
------

The algorithm that scallop uses to compute scl is rigorous
for (finite linear combinations of) *alternating words*:
those where the letters (cyclically) alternate between one
of a,A and b,B. Hence: abAB is alternating, aaab is not, a is not.

For nonalternating input, scallop rigorously computes upper
bounds on scl. Moreover, the output is "statistically" correct
on *most* input, especially if the value of scl is small.

To rigorously compute scl for nonalternating input, take any
input w and replace it by f(w) where f rewrites letters as string
by the substitution rule:

	a -> axa
	A -> AXA
	b -> byb
	B -> BYB

After rewriting, scallop f(w) will rigorously compute scl(w) even
if w is nonalternating. However, in practice, the computation is
much slower, and runs into memory issues much sooner.
